# Dota Wiki
This is a React App project built using the "Thinking in React" principles.  The app is a Wikipedia for a popular game called "Dota2", where you can check Heroes, abilities and items that are inside the game.
The concepts that I have developed in this projects can be easily extended to other web app such e-commerce, online-markets, commercial websites, real estate ecc...

## Data
All the data that are shown are pulled out from files JSON. All data are fetched using useEffect hook.

## Heroes -> Search and Filters
If you navigate to the Heroes section you will noticed that you have the possibility to Search and Filter all the Heroes list, to make it easier for the user to find the data that's looking for. This idea is the same concepts as Amazon or Ebay, where you can filter your research many times to find what you want.

## Builds -> Customization
In this section you will find various custom builds that others have created. Here you have the possibility to delete or inspect them. At the top left there is a button that will take you to the creation page, where you can make your own custom build. In the build section you can add or remove items and when you have it ready you can save it and find it listed together with the other builds.
Also here the idea can be applied on many other cases for exemple a Bike Builder, Car Builder ecc...

## How is it build
The project is build using CRA.
I used functional components and hooks such useState, useEffect and useContext.
The CSS is build up using SCSS.
I used React-Router to implement the routing between pages.
uuidv4 to generate unique Ids.
